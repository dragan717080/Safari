# Safari 🌴 🐘 🐅 🦏 🦌

Safari website built with Nuxt.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, Firebase and Sanity.

## Technologies Used

- **Nuxt.js**

Nuxt.js is a popular open-source framework for building modern web applications with Vue.js. It abstracts away the complex configuration and setup required for building a Vue.js application.
It has built-in support for server-side rendering, file-based routing convention, layouts, views, middleware and plugins.

- **TypeScript**

TypeScript is a strongly typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code maintainability and scalability. It allows us to catch errors during development and provides better tooling support, leading to more robust applications.

- **Tailwind CSS**

Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework that enables rapid UI development. Its utility classes make it easy to create responsive and custom-designed user interfaces without writing custom CSS.

- **Firebase**

Firebase is a comprehensive mobile and web application development platform developed by Google. It offers a wide range of services, including real-time database, authentication, hosting, and cloud functions. Firebase helps to build scalable and feature-rich applications.

- **Sanity**

Sanity is a headless CMS that gives totally composable, fully decoupled, real-time content back end. It has entirely customizable content workspaces.

The goal of using these technologies is to create a high-performing, modern and scalable application.

Please refer to the respective documentation of each technology for more in-depth details and usage instructions.
